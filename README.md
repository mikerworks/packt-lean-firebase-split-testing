Sample of mobile app A/B testing using Firebase (part of the book)

What works best? Run a split test

All successful app developers learn from the feedback they get from their users. They  investigate it and determine if they need to improve, to remove or to add features in order for a better support of the users workflow. In this chapter we will investigate what tools we can use to get feedback from our users if we cannot ask them in person. Multiple iterations of testing and optimizing are required to able to build an app that solves the problem of your customers. Split testing (or A/B testing) is an ongoing process that can help you find the workflow which will lead to the highest conversions. Using split testing you can, for example, find the best registration flow for your app.

This is Android example app. It is written in Kotlin and is created using Android Studio 3
